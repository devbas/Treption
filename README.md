# Manual Triple Extraction Tool
With Treption (a-lack-of-inspiration-temporarily-working-name) we propose a system that enables semantic triple generation by adding a gamified layer on top of existing automatic Information Extraction systems (Research in progress). 

## Setup 
1. Install the latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. Open the project folder in a terminal of your choice
3. enter `docker-compose up --build`
4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000` to start extracting!

## System design
